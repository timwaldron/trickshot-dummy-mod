# Trickshot Dummy Mod
Practice trickshotting against bots in Modern Warfare 2.

I will eventually re-write this README but for now if you're curious about this you can read the old one here.

## Accessing the menu
To open and close the menu you will need to bind a key to `+toggle_menu`  

Open the IW4x console with the `~` key, then enter the command `/bind {key} +toggle_menu`, where `{key}` is the key you want to bind to.  
  
Bind/unbind key examples:  
`/bind i +toggle_menu`  
`/unbind i`

Alternately, once you have loaded the mod, you can bind toggling `i` key by entering the command `/exec bindings`
